# Question: How do you simulate a simplified file system with mkdir, ls, and addContentToFile commands? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript application simulates a simplified file system using a class named FileSystem. The FileSystem class has a constructor that initializes the root of the file system as an empty object. The class has four methods: mkdir, ls, addContentToFile, and readContentFromFile. The mkdir method creates new directories in the file system. It does this by splitting the input path into individual directories, iterating over them, and creating new objects for each directory in the path. The ls method lists all files and directories in a given path. It does this by splitting the input path into individual directories, iterating over them to reach the final directory, and then returning the keys of the final directory object. If the final directory is a file (i.e., a string), it returns the file name. The addContentToFile method adds content to a file. It splits the file path into individual directories, iterates over them to reach the final directory, and then adds or appends the content to the file. The readContentFromFile method reads content from a file. It splits the file path into individual directories, iterates over them to reach the final directory, and then returns the content of the file.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and type-safe compared to the JavaScript version. Here are the key differences:

1. TypeScript introduces static types: In the TypeScript version, the types of variables, parameters, and return values are explicitly declared. This makes the code more predictable and less prone to runtime errors.

2. Use of classes for Directory and File: The TypeScript version introduces two additional classes, `Dir` and `File`, to represent directories and files. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand, as it's clear what each object represents.

3. Use of `for...of` loop: The TypeScript version uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over directories, which is more readable and concise than the `for` loop used in the JavaScript version.

4. Use of `continue` statement: The TypeScript version uses the `continue` statement to skip empty directories, which makes the code cleaner and more efficient.

5. Use of `concat` method: The TypeScript version uses the `concat` method to combine the keys of `dirs` and `files` into a single array, which is more efficient and readable than creating a new array and pushing elements into it.

6. Use of `sort` method: The TypeScript version uses the `sort` method to sort the keys of `dirs` and `files`, which is more efficient and readable than manually sorting the keys.

Overall, the TypeScript version is more robust, readable, and maintainable than the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. 

In the JavaScript version, the file system is represented as a single nested object where each key-value pair represents a directory or a file. The `mkdir`, `ls`, `addContentToFile`, and `readContentFromFile` methods navigate and manipulate this object to simulate the operations of a file system.

In contrast, the C++ version uses two separate data structures to represent the file system: a map of maps (`dirs`) to represent directories and a map (`files`) to represent files. The `mkdir`, `ls`, `addContentToFile`, and `readContentFromFile` methods manipulate these maps to simulate the operations of a file system.

The C++ version uses the `istringstream` and `getline` functions to split the path string into directories, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `split` and `filter` methods. The C++ version uses the `find_last_of` and `substr` methods to extract the file name from the file path, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `pop` method.

The C++ version uses the `count` method to check if a file exists, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `typeof` operator. The C++ version uses the `append` method to add content to a file, whereas the JavaScript version uses the ternary operator to either append content to an existing file or create a new file with the content.

The C++ version uses the `vector` class to store and return the list of files and directories, whereas the JavaScript version uses an array. The C++ version uses the `cout` function to print the output, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `console.log` method.
